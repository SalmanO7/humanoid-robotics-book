# Quickstart Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and start using the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, including how to access the content, run code examples, and use interactive features.

## Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Python 3.8+ for running code examples
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Optional: ROS Noetic/Melodic for ROS-specific examples

## Accessing the Book

1. Navigate to the GitHub Pages deployment of the book
2. Use the sidebar navigation to browse chapters
3. Search for specific topics using the search function
4. Use the table of contents to jump to specific sections

## Running Code Examples

### Python Examples
1. Install required dependencies: `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
2. Copy the example code from the book
3. Run in your local Python environment: `python example.py`
4. Observe the output and modify parameters to understand the concepts

### ROS Examples
1. Set up ROS Noetic or Melodic environment
2. Create a workspace: `mkdir -p ~/robotics_ws/src && cd ~/robotics_ws`
3. Build the workspace: `catkin_make`
4. Source the environment: `source devel/setup.bash`
5. Run the ROS nodes as described in the book

### Simulation Examples
1. Install Gazebo or your preferred simulation environment
2. Follow the setup instructions in the simulation chapter
3. Launch the simulation environments as described in examples

## Using Interactive Demos

1. Navigate to sections with interactive demos
2. Look for the "Interactive Demo" callout boxes
3. Click on the demo links to access remote demonstrations
4. Use the provided controls to interact with humanoid robot models
5. Observe how your inputs affect the robot behavior in real-time

## Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with the "Introduction" and "Getting Started" chapters
2. Progress through fundamentals: kinematics, dynamics, control systems
3. Explore sensors and actuators
4. Study AI applications in humanoid robotics
5. Practice with code examples and exercises
6. Experiment with interactive demos

## Troubleshooting

### Code Examples Not Working
- Verify Python version meets requirements
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Ensure correct working directory when running examples
- Review error messages for specific issues

### Interactive Demos Not Loading
- Check internet connection
- Verify browser compatibility
- Look for any error messages in browser console
- Contact support if issues persist
